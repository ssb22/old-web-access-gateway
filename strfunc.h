Access Gateway - a mediator for the World Wide Web

(C) 1998-2006 Silas S. Brown (St John's College,

This is not intended to be model or example code,
but it is intended to be secure enough to run on a
Web server without compromising it.

If you would like to email me a patch, please first
ensure that you have the latest release, and use
"diff -Naur old-directory new-directory", where
"old-directory" contains the unmodified release
version and "new-directory" contains the
modifications.  Please also include a brief
description of what the patch achieves, your name
(for an acknowledgement), and any copyright
restrictions (ideally the patch should be public
domain).  I may not apply every patch but I do try to
answer my email, unless I am inundated, busy, or
offline for a long time.
