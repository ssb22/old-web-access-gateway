Welcome to the Web access gateway.&nbsp; This is the online help
          file; it is not the same as the gateway's home
          page, which is at <A
          HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ssb22/access.html">www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~ssb22/access.html</A>.

<P>This gateway currently
          has two related purposes:

<P>1.&nbsp; To make the Web easier to access for the visually impaired;
<BR>2.&nbsp; To allow speakers of other languages to view Web pages written
in them, when the encodings are not supported by their browsers.

<P>For help on a particular option, jump straight to the <A
		HREF="#options_list">options list</A>.
There is also a <A HREF="#common_problems">common problems</A> section.

<P>Users of earlier versions may like to note that the language translation
facility has been removed due to inadequacies; also the ``Leave smileys
etc as they are'' option has been replaced by ``Perform smiley substitution''
(ie. substitution is now off by default), because it is slow for large
Web pages and you should only enable it if you really want it.

<P>A description of the gateway follows.
<H3>
The Internet and the World Wide Web</H3>
Briefly, the Internet is a continuously changing global network of links
between computers, arranged in such a way that any two computers connected
to it may communicate with each other.&nbsp; The World Wide Web is an arrangement
that allows some of these computers to store documents, which may be viewed
from other computers on the Internet.

<P>Most of the documents on the World Wide Web are written in Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML).&nbsp; HTML allows links to other documents to be
embedded within a document.&nbsp; Should a link be selected, an attempt
will be made to fetch and display the second document.&nbsp; This may be
stored on a completely different computer.&nbsp; Hence, the whole thing
can become a world wide ``web'' of documents and links between documents.

<P>The documents that you view on the World Wide Web may not have been
stored on any computer.&nbsp; Instead, they may have been generated, by
a computer program running on that computer, especially for your request.&nbsp;
As the user, you may know little difference between a program retrieving
the document from storage and a program generating it.

<P>Programs that generate documents can be given parameters.&nbsp; This
will usually involve you filling in some kind of ``form'' and ``submitting''
it.&nbsp; The computer that your computer is communicating with will then
be told what you have put in the form, and it can use this information
while generating the document that it returns as a result (the remote computer
can also store the information if necessary).

<P>It is also possible to embed parameters in a link, to be put in a document.&nbsp;
Thus, if you as user were to activate the link, it would be as though you
had filled in a form with those parameters.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
``Hijacking'' the Web</H3>
Given the above, it is possible to ``hijack'' somebody's session on the World
Wide Web.&nbsp; Suppose that computer 1 wants to view a document stored
on computer 2.&nbsp; Rather than ask computer 2 for the document, suppose
that it asks computer 3 instead.&nbsp; The nature of the request includes
exactly where the document is to be found, on computer 2.&nbsp; A program
is activated on computer 3, which gets the document from computer 2, and
returns it to computer 1.&nbsp; However, before returning it, it can change
all of the links in the document to point to computer 3.&nbsp; Therefore,
when any of these links are followed, a similar process will happen, and
so on - in effect, computer 3 has become a ``gateway'' to the World Wide
Web for computer 1, arbitrating between computer 1 and the rest of the
world.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
Access Gateway</H3>
There may seem little point in the above arrangement, but the ``gateway''
computer, rather than just retrieving the documents that it is told to
retrieve, can do something useful with them before it returns them.&nbsp;
For example, it can process some of the markup language in order to make
the document easier to read for visually disabled people.&nbsp; It is possible
to configure exactly what is done, since no two people are alike (this
is why it is not implemented as a proxy).

<P>When you view the ``access gateway'', you have a form, which allows you
to type in the URL of some other document on the World Wide Web, for the
gateway to retrieve.&nbsp; There are also several options that allow you
to customise what the gateway does to pages.&nbsp; To get to most of them,
you need to press one of the buttons under the URL box; this arrangement
is to keep the main form simple.

<P>You do not have to set any of the options at this point; if for any
reason you are not happy with them at some later point, or if you would
like to jump to a different page on the World Wide Web that is not in any
of the links, then you may return to the form later.&nbsp; This is done
by following a link at the top of whatever page is being displayed, called
``Change access options''.&nbsp; When you do this, the options will be as
you left them previously, except that the page's URL will be changed to
whatever page you were just viewing, if it were different from the one
that you had entered previously (because you had followed a link).

<P>Saving your options: Once you have found your preferred options, you
can save them on most browsers by either bookmarking the page, or setting
it as your home or start page.&nbsp; The method of doing this will depend
on the software that you are using, so please consult the menus, the online
help, the documentation, or the next person in the computer room.

<P>Note that it is sometimes possible to accidentally leave the access
gateway by following a link in a document, even though the program modifies
links so that they ``go through'' the gateway.&nbsp; This can happen, for
example, if you have enabled Javascript, the document contains a Javascript
program, and that program causes your Web browser to retrieve a different
page directly.&nbsp; Normally, this should not happen, although there are
an increasing number of Javascript programs offering the user a menu of
documents to retrieve.

<P>In addition, the gateway can only process HTML documents.&nbsp; If you
retrieve a document that is not HTML, you will get a message about this,
and a direct link to the document.

(``Noscript'' tags are also removed so any relevant messages are displayed.)&nbsp;
This is because
some web sites add Javascript to open new browser windows with advertisements
in them, or something similar, and these present problems for people
using speech synthesisers or large fonts (some browsers behave very
unusually when the text is too big to fit in the window size specified
by the script, and the script often specifies that the window cannot be scrolled
or resized).

<P>If you really want the gateway to allow Javascript through, switch
          on this option.&nbsp; Note, however, that the Javascript
          might manipulate URLs in a way that is incompatible with the

other documents.&nbsp; They are frequently a problem for blind users using
speech synthesisers, and also partially sighted users who have set large
fonts, especially if the page author did not think of this possibility
while specifying the frame parameters.&nbsp; By default, the program removes
all frames.&nbsp; Instead, it retrieves the documents that they contain,
and inserts them into the document, one after another, separated by horizontal
rules.&nbsp; If you would not like this, then switching this option on
will cause the program to leave frames as they are.

Tables are often incorrectly read by speech software, especially if they
are used to format text into multiple columns on the page.&nbsp; What often
happens is that a line is read from each column in turn.&nbsp; Tables can
also be a problem to people using large fonts, if the browser cannot get
the table to fit on the screen.&nbsp; By default, the access gateway simply
writes out tables into the document, row by row, with colon separators
between the columns and horizontal lines betwen the rows (although
	there are some precautions against excessive numbers of horizontal 
	lines being drawn when a table is there purely for layout
	purposes).&nbsp; If you would prefer tables to be left as they

with their ``alternative'' text.&nbsp; This is text that is hidden in the
image specification, designed for Web browsers that cannot support

height about half way between the two circles, and a closing parenthesis
is like a part of the right hand side of a circle.&nbsp; If you rotate
the whole thing by a quarter-turn clockwise, you get the two small solid
circles aligned horizontally rather than vertically, then the short line
underneath them at approximately their midpoint, now vertical, and then
the part of a circle, now taken from the bottom of one.&nbsp; With a bit
of imagination, these look roughly like a pair of eyes, a nose, and a grinning
mouth.

<P>If you enable this option, the program will replace this idiom with
the word ``grin'' in parentheses, so that it can be read properly by a speech
synthesiser.&nbsp; It also replaces numerous other similar idioms.&nbsp;

for large Web pages, so you should only use it if you need to.

fail to notice this in cases where the end of a table prevents it from

all tables.

<A NAME="characters-button"></A>Other Languages and Encodings</H3>
If you see nonsense characters when you try to view Web pages written in
a different alphabet (or with ideographic characters), and you cannot configure
your browser, then you may find the conversion facility useful.&nbsp; Here
is a simple explanation of the problem:

<P>Computers work in numbers, and a Web page is really lots of numbers.&nbsp;
Every letter of the English alphabet has a number, and your browser knows
which English letter or symbol to display for each number.&nbsp; Other
alphabets also have numbers, and things like Chinese characters have big
numbers because there are lots of them.&nbsp; The big numbers have to be
split into smaller numbers, because each number has to fit in a small space.&nbsp;
Numbers for other alphabets and for Chinese characters are often the same
numbers as the ones that are used by English, so, if the computer is programmed
to display English, then pages in other languages might look like random
English letters and symbols.

<P>Even if the computer is programmed to display another language, it can
still go wrong sometimes.&nbsp; This is because some languages have several
different ways of numbering the letters, or different ways of splitting
the big numbers into smaller ones, and if your computer is programmed to
use one or more of these ways then you can still get pages that are written
in other ways.

<P>This program can read pages that are written in one of these ways, and
give them to your computer as pictures.&nbsp; Pages are not normally written
in this way, partly because it takes more time and computer memory.&nbsp;
The gateway can also be asked to give the characters to your computer
          in other encodings (such as UTF-8); this is quicker than
          pictures but is not supported by all browsers.

<P>You normally only need to tell the program which language the page is
in.&nbsp; The languages in the drop-down boxes are sorted alphabetically
by their English names, and you can get near a language by pressing its
first letter on most browsers.&nbsp; The program will detect between the
various types of encodings appropriate to the language, and I hope to improve
this detection code in future.&nbsp; If you want to override the detection
to a particular encoding, then you can do this by pressing ``Override'' after
getting the page.

<P>
<!-- @@Option: Aelh -->
If you have some experience in converting between encodings, then you
may be concerned about documents that encode high bytes as HTML
          numerical ampersand

Normally the gateway will try to detect the character set
          being used by the text, independently of what the

          servers are configured to give wrong
          information.&nbsp; However, the gateway does
          process certain ``charset'' headers, if they
          are appropriate to the language being

The ``alternative base URL for images'' box is mainly for situations
	  where more than one image server is available.&nbsp; It is
	  normally set to a sensible default by the webmaster on the
	  language entry form, and can be left alone unless you really
	  know what you're doing.

<P>Note: The access gateway program is written in such a way that it can
be run on different web servers.&nbsp; Some webmasters may decide not to
include the encoding options, or not to include the images, to save space.&nbsp;
If you find that these options are not available, then that is the explanation.

<OL><LI><B>The web server tells me to go away and come back with a
		  Version 4 browser or cookies.</B>
<BR>This should not normally happen, since the access gateway pretends 
		to be a Version 4 browser and emulates cookies if it
            can.&nbsp; However, some
		installations have a dated version of Lynx (the program the
		gateway uses to get the web pages), and versions of Lynx
		before 2.8 do not allow browser fakery.&nbsp; Try a different
		installation if possible.
</LI><LI><B>When I try to view a language, all the characters come out
			  as squares.</B>
<BR>Check that the language is supported by the image server you are
		using.&nbsp; Check that nobody has set a wrong URL under the
		Characters button (try deleting any URL there).
</LI><LI><B>Some of the gateways are out of date</B>
<BR>Badger their webmasters.&nbsp; I have no control over the ones
		that are out of date, although I do plea that they keep in
		step.
</LI><LI><B>Why do I always get Japanese-style characters while I am
              not Japanese?</B>
<BR>Some Traditional or Simplified Chinese characters, and some Korean
            characters, use the same unicode 
		codepoints as Japanese.&nbsp; The gateway should use the
		appropriate versions for Chinese and Korean pages, but if the
            correct versions are not available on the server you are
            using then the gateway might attempt to use the Japanese
            versions instead.&nbsp; If this proves too difficult to
            read, try using a different server.
</LI><LI><B>The language options are not available</B>
<BR>This is because not all servers have installed them.&nbsp; Some
		webmasters are concerned about the load on their servers.
</LI><LI><B>The gateway still doesn't make the page accessible.</B>
<BR>Perhaps it relies on images a lot, which contain textual
		information and do not have ALT tags, or perhaps it relies on
            plug-ins.&nbsp; There is little I
		can do about that short of OCR.&nbsp; Write to the webmaster.
